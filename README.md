# Prims-Mininmum-Spanning-Tree-Solver-Python-with-Steps
the Program Solves for the minimum spanning tree using prim's algorithm with each and every detailed step.

The cost adjacency matrix is calculated from the inputs and instructions till the final spanning tree is displayed.
 
 INPUT:
 
 1. Number of edges -> n.
 2. n number of edges with their weights : ( v1 ,v2 , w)
 
 OUTPUT:
 
 1. Cost Adjacency Matrix
 2. Detailed steps from the Algorithm iteration and states of the structures
 3. The final edges for spanning Tree
 3. Minimum Cost
